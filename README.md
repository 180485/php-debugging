# php-debugging :honeybee:
Our first little step at php looking for some bugging and fixing the problem,

# Learning objectives :books:

- understanding the root of bug fixing
- know what print_r, var_dump, die, echo, exit, break do
- know what to do the next time you're stuck
- give yourself the solver's mentality, a problem is just an opportunity to learn!

# The Mission :sunglasses:

Debugging is the pinpoint to being a master in any coding language.
Everyone gets errors, but the best programmers never let it stop them and they find a way to fix it .
every time! I scoured the internet for a debugging guide,This is what I feel like doing when coding PHP 
that doesn't mean that this should be your way. Discover, look up, research whatever ways work for you to debug you code!


# Tools :wrench:
- Webbrowser (Chrome, Firefox, IE)
- XAMPP (Apache, MariaDB, PHP)
- Visual Studio Code
